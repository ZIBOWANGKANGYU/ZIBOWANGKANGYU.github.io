## Summary: misconception, misinformation and COVID-19 pandemic control

Since the beginning of the pandemic, governments and technology companies around the world have prioritized combating false information about the COVID-19, along with public health measures, to ensure that people take adequate caustion and change their behavior to slow down the spread of the virus. In this project, we demontrated strong statistical relationships between peopleâ€™s increased physical mobility and worse outcomes of COVID, as measured by infection, hospitalization and death at the state level. Moreover, we discovered that the incorrect information problem to COVID-19 containment turns our to be broader than misinformation from social or traditional media and extends to a lack of basic knowledge about the cause, spread and prevention of COVID-19 (misconception). Misconception is associated with higher non-essential mobility and worse disease outcomes.

Based on our models, we identified US states where, by geographic and demographic characters, where people are most vulnerable to the COVID-19 misconception or misinformation. We believe that the dissemination of correct information to people who are not necessarily exposed to much misinformation from the media, but nonetheless have more misconceptions about the basics of COVID-19.

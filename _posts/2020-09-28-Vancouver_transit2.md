# Usage of public transit

Fortunately, Canada's 2016 census provides abundant information about residents' usage of public transit to the DA level. In the "Journey to Work" section, the numbers of residents falling into the following categories are provided:
- commuters (aged 15 or older, living in private housing)
- commuters using truck, car or van to go to work as drivers
- commuters using truck, car or van to go to work as passengers
- commuters using public transport
- people who walk to work
- people who cycle to work
- people who commute to work with other methods

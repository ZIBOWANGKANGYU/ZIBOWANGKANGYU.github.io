Welcome to my page!

I am currently pursuing Master of Data Science degree at University of British Columbia. I am passionate about data science and machine learning, and have data analytics work experience in management consulting, finance, economics and social science research. I am fluent in Python, R and ArcGIS.

In this blog, I write on my research interests in labor economics, transit and urban development. For more details about my personal projects, please see my [GitHub account](https://github.com/ZIBOWANGKANGYU). You can find my resume in PDF format [here](https://github.com/ZIBOWANGKANGYU/ZIBOWANGKANGYU.github.io/raw/master/_includes/Kangyu_Mark_Wang_resume_GH_publish.pdf).

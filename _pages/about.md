Welcome to my page!

I am a R developer and data enthusiast based in the Greater Totonto Area. I am passionate about data science and machine learning. I am fluent in R, Python and SQL, and have data analytics work experience in management consulting, finance, economics and social science research. 

In this blog, I write on my personal projects covering a wide range of topics. For more details about my personal projects, please see my [GitHub account](https://github.com/ZIBOWANGKANGYU). You can find my resume in PDF format [here](https://github.com/ZIBOWANGKANGYU/ZIBOWANGKANGYU.github.io/raw/master/_includes/Kangyu_Mark_Wang_resume_GH_publish.pdf).
